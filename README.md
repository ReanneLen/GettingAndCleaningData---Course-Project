# GettingAndCleaningData---Course-Project
Repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data from a raw data that can be used for later analysis. 
This repository contains the following files (aside from this README.md) :
1) a tidy data set (tidy_data.txt);
2) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data (CodeBook.md);and 
3) the R script used to create the said tiny data set (run_analysis.R) which particularly:
    a) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
    b) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
    c) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
    d) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names; and 
    e) From the data set in (d), creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each         subject.
